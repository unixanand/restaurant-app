I am creating a docker image for my existing streamlit restaurant app. While running the container I am using the -e option to pass the DB variables. But why the streamlit is unable to connect to oracle DB if I miss to pass the -e option while running the docker? Because I am using load env function in my streamlt and I have .env file in my directory with DB connection variables. Why streamlit is unable to connect DB if I miss the -e option ducring the docker run?
